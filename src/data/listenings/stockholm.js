      "I am renting out a nice double room on the top floor in a large duplex apartment in the center of Stockholm at Södermalm. Close to metro and bus and walking distance to most of the sights. ROOM: The room has a twin/double bed (2x90x200cm, in the US it is usually called King Size), table, wardrobe and bookshelves. The bed linen and towels are included.  The room is located on the top floor in the apartment, where the guests share a large TV-room. In the TV-room you can also find a micro, a fridge and a water kettle to make coffee and tea.  There is one bathroom shared between the bedrooms on the upper floor.  SÖDERMALM: Södermalm has a lot of nice restaurants, pubs, cinema and shopping. From the apartment it takes a few mins walk to the trendy area of SOFO and 15 mins walk to the Old town (Gamla Stan). PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION: - 7 mins walk to underground Mariatorget (red line) or Medborgarplatsen (green line) and it takes then around 5 mins to get to T-centralen (central train station) -",

Airport bus from Stockholm Arlanda stops about three blocks away; a 5-10 minute walk.  Four supermarkets are located within a couple of blocks. All are open until 10 or 11 pm.  There is a 7 Eleven convenience store one block away which is open 6 am to 2 am every day.  You can buy all types of local transportation tickets there as well as bicycle passes and the Stockholm tourist card.   I suggest you get a 24 hour, 72 hour or 7 day unlimited subway/bus pass if you plan on using public transportation - it is very good value. Single tickets are expensive.

We keep them in the entrance hall. Please do the same. Use only plastic cooking tools for the teflon frying pans and keep the sofa covers on.  ALL windows must be closed and locked when you're not in the apartment! Also, be considerate of the environment by shutting off all lights when you leave the apartment, remove battery chargers from the outlets when not in use, turn off the kitchen stove fan as well as the bathroom towel dryer.

Check out the peculiar Copper Tents and the Butterfly House! A classic Stockholm restaurant, one of the city's best, is Tranan. It's 3 blocks away from the apartment :) They're widely known to make some of the finest traditional Swedish food in the country. Try the Swedish meatballs, Pelle Janzon, and bleak roe toast.  A more recent star in the \"new Nordic\" food scene (also just round the corner!) is Lilla Ego. The menu changes every day, and they're known for delicious, simple, modern takes on Swedish cuisine. Booking in advance is probably necessary, but it's worth planning for. Small & cozy, great spot",

With a population of 99,685 (December 2008) it is one of the most densely populated districts of Scandinavia. Although Södermalm usually is considered an island, water to both its north and south does not flow freely but passes through locks. My apartment is next to Slussen subway and from here you can easy access hole Stockholm with public transport.  Gamla Stan (old town) is just 3-5 min walk from my door, its a must for first visit to Stockholm. In Gamla Stan you find the Royal Palace, just around 5-6 min walk from my door.

      "I work as a researcher at the Physics Department at Stockholm University. A couple of years ago me and my family bought this fantastic house in Stockholm, located within a walking distance from popular Södermalm in Stockholm City. I love spending time with my family in our amazing garden, go for a swim in the nearby lake or take a bike ride to one of the lovely garden cafes nearby. Another of my main intrests is to take care and refine our house. Me and my family now want to give you the oppertunity to stay in our dream house. I can't think of a better way to experience the beautiful capital of Sweden. Staying in our house means that you will live in a calm and green part of Stockholm but at the same time you are just a few minutes away from Stockholm City with all it has to offer.\nLooking forward to hosting you",

    neighborhood_overview:
      "Your private studio is located in the city area of Stockholm, also called Norrmalm. This neighbourhood is the place for affordable shopping, food and entertainment. Just a few mins away is the street Drottninggatan which offers a wide range of restaurants, boutiques, bars, cafes, pubs and department stores. Supermarkets, grocery stores and convenience shops are very nearby and just minutes away.  Approx 5 mins walk away is Hötorgshallen food hall and the colorful market on the adjacent square. Approx 10 mins walk away is NK (Nordiska kompaniet), on Hamngatan, which is a national institution when it comes to fashion & design, and the nearby MOOD Stockholm is a new mall with shopping, food, and service.  For a break from the hustle and bustle of the city center and approx 15 mins walk away from your private studio, you´ll find that Kungsträdgården is perfect for ice cream and people-watching; during spring thousands of pink cherry blossoms light up the park and when winter comes, the ice",
    notes:
      "I am a retired teacher and I manage this Airbnb with help from my son Gabriel, after my late husband Karl & I used to run this private studio together. I live in the larger apartment, which your private studio is an independent part of. As your studio originally is a room of my larger apartment, you may hear me occasionally through the locked, interconnecting doors. Please remember that you’re staying in a residential house, not a hotel. Please treat the space with respect. If any problems arise, I will do my best to take action ASAP, but I may not be on site 24/7.",
    transit:
      "This absolutely superb location is on convenient walking distance to most things to do and explore in central Stockholm and the city’s many tourist attractions. If you prefer public transport, the nearest underground station is called Rådmansgatan and it is only 2 blocks away, approx 5 mins walk from your private studio. Rådmansgatan underground station is just 2 stops away from T-Centralen (approx 4 mins underground journey), which is the main hub of the extensive public transport (SL) in Stockholm, airport coaches and Swedens national rail (SJ). As Stockholm might be a new and big city for you to get around, I will be pleased to help you find your way around and feel safe.  For an easy-to-use public transit app and mapping service, I recommend to download and use the free mobile app Citymapper.",
    access:
      "You have complete access to your private studio, consisting of the main room, WC/shower as well as the kitchenette.  There is a general laundry room easily accessible on the backyard of the building, providing general communal laundry facilities for the residents. You may use this self-service, available upon request and at no extra charge. The general laundry room is equipped with washing machines, tumble dryer and a drying cabinet, detergent is provided. Booking the general laundry room in advance is required and availability is only on request basis.",
    interaction:
      "As your private studio is a self contained place, you will have full privacy once you’ve checked in. I give my guests space but I am available to contact when needed, I’m only a phone call/message away. You will be able to self check-out upon your departure.",

      "Älvsjö is an old residetial area with lots of beautiful nature areas preserved, within only 10 minutes reach of the city centre by commute train. In recent years the centre of Älvsjö has started developing towards a more urban atmosphere, with many new services adding to the previous suburban small-town ones. I love having the quiet and closeness to nature, waking up to blue skies and birds' singing and going for an afternoon stroll in the woods, while still having near access to all modern services and being in swift and easy reach of the more busy and vibrant city centre!",

      "The apartment is situated within a five minute walk to Älvsjö Station, from where the local commute trains run very frequently into the centre. The travel time from Älvsjö to the South Station is 6 minutes and to the Central Station 10 minutes. Twice an hour runs a commute train from Älvsjö going all the way to Uppsala, via Arlanda Airport. Last but not least Älvsjö Station is a hub for a number of buses to the surrounding southern areas, including the red underground line trafficing Telefonplan/Fruängen and the green line trafficing Högdalen/Hagsätra.",

      "Hi there, \n\nTogether with my partner Keith I've had the privilege to host many wonderful travellers as well as a few chances to be a visitor myself through AirBnB. Before joining AriBnB we both used to host - and on a few occasions surf - within the nonprofit organisation Couchsurfing. \n\nIf freely given a choice I most like playing volleyball or beach volleyball, watching films or reading books, crafting - presently I've caught the knitting bug - or making up songs to sing and play on the piano. Before moving to Peterborough, England, I've lived in various villages, towns and cities in Sweden (Luleå, Uppsala, Stockholm and Linköping), in Dublin, Ireland and in New York, USA.",

Very quiet and secluded, but close to everything in the village. I spend my summers and holidays here with my partner Melker and all our children of 19, 16, 15, 12 and 11. \n\nCozy flat - My home is centrally located in Stockholm. Just around the corner is Odenplan, a hotspot for great cafes, bars and restaurants. At Odenplan you find the nearest subway stop and buses. In summer it is easy to rent bikes there as well.

The apartment, has 2 bedrooms, can take as many as six people and still be comfortable. It has a large social kitchen, with a table that easily fits 6 people. The bathroom has a tub and washing machine. The larger bedroom has a 160 cm bed and one smaller has a 120 cm bed. There are also two sleeping arrangements in the living room. One person can sleep in the very comfortable sofa and one person will dwell in an as comfortable folded bed (which is 85 cm wide). Thus, the apartment can hold 6 people only if two people share each of the bedrooms. Nice and cozy :) I will gladly give tips on things to do both in Stockholm and in the area around Hägersten.",

The reason I'm doing it is because I like to book through Airbnb myself and I thought I should return the favor. \n\nI'm working as a researcher at Karolinska Institutet (a Swedish medical university) and many of my travels are work related. However, I also enjoy travelling on my spare time. Since I'm only letting my apartment when I'm travelling I will not meet you in person, most often it is my good friend and colleagueJohan that will meet you. \n\nFeel free to ask anything. I hope i will hear from you and I'm sure you will enyoj staying at my place.\n\nBest wishes, \nAlex",

    neighborhood_overview:
      "Bagarmossen is a cozy and vibrant suburb to Stockholm,  that's had a revival the past years.  The creatives, artists and musicians that once inhabited the hip island of Södermalm, have left the staggering prices of the inner city for a more community focused life in Bagarmossen. It's a very active part of Stockholm where a lot of things are going on; urban gardening projects, one of the biggest outdoor 2nd hand markets happens here once a year, a one-man made Zen Garden, bee hives, and a supermarket cashier that's known all over town - there's even a book about her!",
    notes: "Wifi available. Sheets and towels included.",
    transit:
      "Bagarmossen subway station is an 8 minutes walk away,  Kärrtorp subway station 10 minutes by foot.  The subway takes 8-22 minutes into the city,  depending on where you want to go! (Skanstull: 8 min, Central Station: 15 min, Fridhemsplan: 22 min) There's also a bus stop 2 minutes from the front door,  the bus takes only 5 minutes to Skogskyrkogården,  a World Heritage Site,  which also has it's own subway stop.",

    summary:
      "Lovely atelier apartment right in the middle of the popular Sofo area. Close to everything yet calm at night. Business ready, fully equipped with 100 Mbit wifi.",
    space:
      "Close to Nytorget, in the popular area Sofo, I have my wonderful appartment in a building from the late 20's. The flat is well planned, has a harmonious feel and many crafty details and parquet flooring. Spacious, light and very quiet bedroom with balcony facing south. 180 cm double bed. Big hall with a fire place. Bathroom with tub. Atelier towards the street with library and a desk for working. Cosy kitchen for breakfasts and dinners. A shared service for washing and drying clothes in the basement. A note on the photos, they're three years old and I need to update them. The place is the same but I've moved around things plus I've been working full time in the atelier so there are much more books, paint and paintings in there.",
